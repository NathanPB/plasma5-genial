Not absolutely required, but try to follow these rules when writing code to Plasma 5 Genial:

# General

- Write in English

  Don't need to be perfect and follow all the dictionary rules, but write something that everyone can understand
  
- **No Ninja Coding**

  Try to put a name in the variables/objects/anything that actually describe what its doing there. Not ``a``, ``b``, or something like this

- Document your methods and types
  
  Add a bit of explanation about what your method/variable/type should do
  
  
  # Syntax
  
- Curly braces in the same line as the statement
  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>

    ```
    if() {
    ```
    not
    ```
    if()
    {
    ```
  </details>

- Spaces after and before each open curly braces

  <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    
    ```
    if() {
    ```
    not
    ```
    if(){
    ```
      
  </details>

**These rules are not absolutely required, I won't refuse your code if you forgot a trailing space or something, but try to follow it =)**
